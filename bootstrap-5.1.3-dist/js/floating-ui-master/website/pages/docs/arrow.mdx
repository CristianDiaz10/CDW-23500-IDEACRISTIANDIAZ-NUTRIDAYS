# arrow

The `arrow{:.function}` middleware provides data to position an
inner element of the floating element, usually the triangle or
caret which points toward the reference element, so that it is
centered to it.

If you're using an aligned placement, like `'top-start'{:js}` or
`'right-end'{:js}`, you may not need to use this middleware if
you want the arrow's position to remain "static".

## Usage

Add a new element inside your floating element, ensuring it has
`position: absolute{:sass}` applied in its CSS:

```html
<div id="tooltip">
  Tooltip text
  <div id="arrow"></div>
</div>
```

Then, pass the arrow element and assign the dynamic styles:

```js
import {computePosition, arrow} from '@floating-ui/dom';

const arrowEl = document.querySelector('#arrow');

computePosition(referenceEl, floatingEl, {
  middleware: [
    arrow({
      element: arrowEl,
    }),
  ],
}).then(({middlewareData}) => {
  const {x, y} = middlewareData.arrow;

  Object.assign(arrowEl.style, {
    left: x != null ? `${x}px` : '',
    top: y != null ? `${y}px` : '',
  });
});
```

This middleware is designed only to position the arrow on one
axis (`x` for `'top'{:js}` or `'bottom'{:js}` placements). The
other axis is considered "static", which means it does not need
to be positioned dynamically.
[You can see a full styling example in the Tutorial](/docs/tutorial#arrow-middleware).

## Options

```ts
type Options = {
  element: any; // `HTMLElement` for the DOM
  padding: Padding;
};
```

### element

This is the arrow element to be positioned.

```js
arrow({
  element: document.querySelector('#arrow'),
});
```

### padding

```ts
type Padding = number | SideObject;
```

This describes the padding between the arrow and the edges of the
floating element. If your floating element has
`border-radius{:.function}`, this will prevent it from
overflowing the corners.

```js
arrow({
  element: document.querySelector('#arrow'),
  padding: 5, // stop 5px from the edges of the floating element
});
```

## Data

The following data is available in `middlewareData.arrow{:js}`:

```ts
type Data = {
  x?: number;
  y?: number;
  centerOffset: number;
};
```

### x

This property exists if the arrow should be offset on the x-axis.

### y

This property exists if the arrow should be offset on the y-axis.

### centerOffset

This property describes where the arrow actually is relative to
where it could be if it were allowed to overflow the floating
element in order to stay centered to the reference element.

This enables two useful things:

- You can hide the arrow if it can't stay centered to the
  reference, i.e. `centerOffset !== 0{:js}`.
- You can interpolate the shape of the arrow (e.g. skew it) so it
  stays centered as best as possible.
